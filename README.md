### Waldo Lab Part 1  ###

As a part of the MEAM 510 Mechatronics Course, C code for the following was written:
     - First nested list item

You will be creating a Waldo that has at least 2 degrees-of-freedom. This means it will have two joints
which can be controlled independently. (You can make more if you want but even two will be a lot of
work.) In this first part of the lab you will be building the sensing portion of the Waldo.
